I am currently a Ph.D. student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), advised by [Prof. Hong Xu](https://henryhxu.github.io/). I also work with [Prof. Juncheng Wang](https://www.juncheng-wang.com/) of [HKBU](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/). I hold a B.S. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology and a M.S. degree from Tsinghua University.

**Research Interests**: My research focuses on the (theoretical) foundation of solving mathematical optimization problems with learning-based methods. I try to improve the theoretical boundaries of existing algorithms by learning. I am also interested in enhancing the theoretical efficiency and reliability of learning-based models.
